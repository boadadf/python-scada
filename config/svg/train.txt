This is the model train simulation
Press on the RaspberryPi button to connect/disconnect to the IO driver
Press on the left control to change the switch (straight / turn)
If the switches do not have the same state (both straight or both turn) an alarm is triggered
A popup is displayed to set both switches to the same state
Go to the alarm tab to ack the alarm
